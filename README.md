# FeatureFlag

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is powered by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first styling, [Lodash](https://lodash.com) for bullet-proof utility functions and [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) for conditional classNames.

Treat it like an MVP with a space for improvement:

- [x] Proof of concept
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Performance
- [ ] Media queries
- [ ] Accessibility
